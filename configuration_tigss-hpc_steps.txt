These are some notes on how to set up your system to run the penalty calculation workflow used in downstream QTL-analyses.
Sandra K. Truong 2017-01-30

Requirements:

TIGSS-HPC account: https://genomics.tamu.edu/register-account-tigss-hpc-cluster
File Transfer Protocol (e.g. FileZilla): https://filezilla-project.org/
QTL-analysis penalty scripts from GitHub: https://github.com/thkhavi/QTL-analysis/blob/master/tigss-hpc_rqtl_penalty_folders.zip
R: https://cran.r-project.org/ (see steps below)

Steps to set up:

1a. Open FileZilla
2a. Go to File -> Site Manager
3a. Add New Site
	Host: tigss-hpc.tamu.edu
	Port: 
	Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
	Logon Type: Normal
	User: {username}
	Password: {username password}
4a. Connect to tigss-hpc
5a. Transfer folders downloaded and modified (see instructions on GitHub) from GitHub on your local computer to your tigss-hpc account:
	/data/{username}/rqtl_crosses
	/data/{username}/rqtl_mqm_output
	/data/{username}/rqtl_mqm_scripts
6a. Transfer R crossobject saved from save_crossobject_rqtl.R on local computer to your tigss-hpc account:
	/data/{username}/rqtl_crosses/{crossobject}

1b. Open terminal
2b. Sign in to TIGSS-HPC
	$ ssh {username}@tigss-hpc.tamu.edu
3b. Get R and Rscript binaries (choose R versiof, if necessary, by going to https://cran.r-project.org/):
	$ mkdir /data/{username}/downloads
	$ cd /data/{username}/downloads
	$ wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.3.2.tar.gz
	$ tar zxvf R-3.3.2.tar.gz
	$ cd /data/{username}/downloads/R-3.3.2
4b. Compile R and Rscript on head node:
	$ exit
	$ ./compile
	$ make
5b. Install R/qtl package in R
	$ /data/thkhavi/downloads/R-3.3.2/bin/Rscript
	$ install.packages(qtl)
	$ quit()

After these steps are complete, the workflow from https://github.com/thkhavi/QTL-analysis can be followed.
